# AuraSub
**Precision-Driven Semantic Translation & Dubbing for Professional Content**

</div>

## 🌟 Overview

**AuraSub** is a specialized, enhanced branch derived from the original VideoLingo project. Compared to the original project, AuraSub's core differences lie in its **LLM-based intelligent sentence segmentation, phonetic ASR error correction, highly optimized terminology translation mechanism, two-tier reasoning control, and real-time subtitle preview customization.**

While the original project relies on traditional NLP algorithms for sentence breaking—which often fail and cause misaligned chunks when handling complex professional lectures—AuraSub completely abandons physical NLP slicing. Instead, it uses LLMs for logical, context-aware sentence segmentation, **delivering a massive leap in segmentation accuracy and contextual coherence** compared to the original project. Furthermore, AuraSub introduces a targeted phonetic correction engine that repairs misheard professional terms at the root timestamp level, without relying on "full-scale context injection" that pollutes the translation prompt.

### Core Differences & Features:
- **🧠 Pure LLM Intelligent Chunking:** Replaces mechanical NLP (e.g., SpaCy). It uses an LLM to logically deduce punctuation and segment unpunctuated transcripts into cohesive clauses, offering a massive leap in chunking quality.
- **🗣️ Zero-Loss ASR Phonetic Correction:** An exclusive pipeline that scans for misheard terms. It uses your custom glossary and regex word boundaries to surgically fix single or multi-word phonetic errors globally within the underlying timestamp data before translation begins.
- **📚 Optimized Terminology without Pollution:** Incorporates exact regex word-boundary matching during the translation phase. This allows the LLM to use your glossary accurately without being overwhelmed by massive "full-text terminology injections," effectively eliminating context pollution.
- **🪡 Robust Two-Pointer Alignment:** A custom alignment engine mathematically matches translated blocks back to their precise word-level audio timestamps, entirely avoiding the missing timeline issues of previous iterations.
- **🧠 Two-Tier Reasoning Control:** Allows configuring different reasoning intensities (e.g., `low`, `medium`, `high` via API request bodies) for hard vs. easy tasks in the WebUI to maximize translation quality and cost-efficiency.
- **🎨 Subtitle Style & Real-Time Preview:** Features a dedicated customization block for adjusting font sizes. Employs a unified ASS subtitle generation scheme for zero-overlap double-line text, and renders single-frame previews of the longest sentences instantly without repeating the translation workflow.
- **✅ Netflix-Standard Exclusivity:** Enforces strict single-line subtitles only, guaranteeing a clean, professional viewing experience.
- **🎙️ Advanced Dubbing:** Seamless integration with GPT-SoVITS, Azure, OpenAI TTS, and more for one-click multilingual dubbing.
- 🎥 **Solid Foundation:** Inherits VideoLingo's excellent frame.


### Language Support

**Input Languages:**
🇺🇸 English | 🇷🇺 Russian | 🇫🇷 French | 🇩🇪 German | 🇮🇹 Italian | 🇪🇸 Spanish | 🇯🇵 Japanese | 🇨🇳 Chinese

**Translation & Dubbing:**
Translation supports practically all languages powered by leading LLMs. Dubbing support depends on the chosen TTS provider.

## Installation

> **Note:** To use NVIDIA GPU acceleration on Windows, please complete the following steps first:
> 1. Install [CUDA Toolkit 12.6](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.6.0/local_installers/cuda_12.6.0_560.76_windows.exe)
> 2. Install [CUDNN 9.3.0](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cudnn/9.3.0/local_installers/cudnn_9.3.0_windows.exe)
> 3. Add `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA\CUDNN\v9.3\bin\12.6` to your system PATH
> 4. Restart your computer

> **Note:** FFmpeg is required. Please install it via package managers:
> - Windows: ```choco install ffmpeg``` (via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/))
> - macOS: ```brew install ffmpeg``` (via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/))
> - Linux: ```sudo apt install ffmpeg``` (Debian/Ubuntu) or ```sudo dnf install ffmpeg``` (Fedora)

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourOrg/AuraSub.git
cd AuraSub
```

2. Install dependencies (requires `python=3.10`)

```bash
conda create -n aurasub python=3.10.0 -y
conda activate aurasub
python install.py
```

3. Start the application

```bash
streamlit run st.py
```

### Docker
Alternatively, you can use Docker (requires CUDA 12.4 and NVIDIA Driver version >550):

```bash
docker build -t aurasub .
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 --gpus all aurasub
```

## 📝 Custom Terminology & ASR Correction
AuraSub features a powerful context-based phonetic correction engine. While it can automatically fix common misheard words, providing a domain-specific glossary will significantly enhance accuracy:
1. In the project root, duplicate `custom_terms_template.xlsx` and rename it to `custom_terms.xlsx`.
2. Enter your specialized vocabulary (e.g., `buccal`, `Anchorage`) into the first column of the spreadsheet.
3. During processing, AuraSub will prioritize your glossary to regex-scan and automatically surgically repair misheard terms within the raw audio timeline.

## API Configuration
AuraSub supports OpenAI-like API formats for reasoning and translation:
- Supported LLMs: Supports virtually all current mainstream large models (as long as they can output JSON format, they can complete this workflow perfectly).
- Supported TTS: `azure-tts`, `openai-tts`, `fish-tts`, `GPT-SoVITS`, `edge-tts`, and more.

## Current Limitations

1. WhisperX transcription performance may be affected by heavy background noise (using wav2vec alignment). For best results on professional content, clean audio tracks are preferred.
2. Due to strict JSON schema validation in the LLM pipeline, using weaker, non-reasoning LLMs may cause intermediate step failures. If this occurs, delete the `output` folder and retry with a stronger model (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, or DeepSeek).
3. The dubbing feature synchronizes speaking rates dynamically, but language structural differences mean it may require manual tweaking for absolute perfection.
4. **Multilingual recognition** defaults to the primary detected language due to WhisperX's specialized single-language alignment constraint.
